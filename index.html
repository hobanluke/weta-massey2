        <div class="bootcamp-heading"><p>Step 1: Review your qualifications structure and select your courses</p></div>
        <p>
        Each qualification has its own structure which is explained in the Programmes and courses web pages. When you select your courses you need to ensure that you fulfil all of your qualification requirements to be able to graduate.</p>
        <p>
        You can also view our general planning information which includes advice about which courses you should study first.
        </p>
        <p>
        The programme of study you design will be checked for approval when you submit your enrolment. If you need further help with planning your programme contact the programme coordinators listed in the Programme and courses web pages or contact our academic advice team for assistance. 
        </p>
        <div class="bootcamp-heading"><p>Step 3: Check out the due dates for adding courses</p></div>
        <p>
        Make sure you know the due dates for adding courses so you don't miss out.
        </p>
        <div class="bootcamp-heading"><p>Step 4: Apply for courses</p></div>
        <p>
        You can apply for courses by logging into your student homepage and clicking the Qualifications and courses tab.

        <span style="  color: #999;
        font-weight: 700;
        letter-spacing: -.01em;">Internal (on-campus) students</span><br> 
        For full-time students, the recommended maximum number of credits in Semester One and Semester Two is 60 credits per semester. So for first year (100-level) courses this means a maximum of four courses each semester. You can apply to study 75 credits per semester, but approval will depend on your past academic performance. For all students, the maximum number of credits for Summer School is 60.
        </p>
        <p>
        Part-time students should enrol for fewer credits per semester. A 15 credit course typically requires 10 hours of study per week, so you need to make a realistic assessment of how many hours you have available for study when you plan your courses.
        </p>
        <p>
        <span style="  color: #999;
        font-weight: 700;
        letter-spacing: -.01em;">Distance students</span><br>
        For distance students the number of courses you can take depends on your other commitments. You will need to spend approximately 10 to 12.5 hours each week for a 15 credit single semester course, or about 5 to 6.25 hours per week for a 15 credit double semester course. If you are working full time (or have a young family that you look after full time), we recommend that you take no more than 30 credits (two courses) in a semester.
        </p>
